    "# COMMUNICATE RESULTS TO STAKEHOLDERS\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project was to learn how to communicate effectively as  a data prefoessional with people whose data skills might not be as sharp as your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "In project 10, you can have direct request from your manager. But many times, you will be recruited to work on multiteam projects. These projects tend to be relatively huge and:\n",
    "- They usually have a project manager (someone that is responsible for overseeing the project from the start till the end).\n",
    "- Because the projects are expensive, they usually require sponsors (usually high up in the hierarchy, responsible for vision and accomplishment of the project).\n",
    "- Representatives of the participating teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "These people are often referred as stakeholders. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes in functional organization, you have to communicate with a large swath of peoople. They will have varying degrees of data litercy, which makes it harder to not only report results, but also:\n",
    "- make it harder for these colleagues to request things of you.\n",
    "- make it harderr for you to manage a larged and varied influx of requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here comes the scenerio: You are working for one of Google's data science team and someone from another team, specifically an account manager (a person who works for a company and its responsible for the managemnet of sales and relationships with particular customer), approaches you with a request: She wants to take a prophylactic approach and improve the revenue of undervalued apps to motivate the developers to keep working on them. As her department's budget for marketing will not allow her to invest on ads, the only way to boost the sale is by tweaking the price. She requests that you determine which paid apps are undervalued (meaning their price could be increased without lowering demand). You talk it over with your mamnager and decide to give this request a try with prototyping this project. That is making a rough analysis with some tax assumptions instead of a full-fledged analysis. Prototyping has several advantages:\n",
    "- Having prototype makes it mcuh easier to estimate the cost of a fully fleshed-out project.\n",
    "- Having more accurate estinate of the cost allows decision-makers not to go through with thte project if it does not seem profitable enough, or not the best allocation of resourcfes at that point in time. \n",
    "- It allows grunt workers to change and add missing requirements to complete the project. Oftentimes they are overlooked and only spotted later (missing data, creation of new database, developement of an API).\n",
    "- It allows business people to tweak the project's goal.\n",
    "- It gives all stakeholders an opportunity to add easily accomplishable sidegoals given the main goal, thus maximizing the project's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "You decide that not only limit the scope of the project ( focusing on 1 goal) when prototyping, but you should also timebox it. Becasue prototyping without a deadline runs the danger of becoming time wasters that do not let you capitalize on the above advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the old dataset from project 1, but this time we will leverage the power of pandas. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps).\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's make a summary for our work that we can use for a presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data quality\n",
    "\n",
    "We found 1 erroneuos data point which was not relevant to our goal of this project, so we decided to ignore it. We should monitor this if management decides to move forward with the project to make sure it does not become an issue later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also found some duplicates but they were easy to handle from the beginning, let's say to reduce of risk of them causing troubles later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Apps Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the main goal of this project is to find undervalued apps, price is the central theme through which our analysis would resolve around. As a whole, the distribution of prices among apps is tremendously right-skewed. The vast majority of apps costs less than 50 dollars with some outliers. Hence, we removed the outliers and focused on apps cost less than 50 dollars. We ended up with a little over 700 data points. Among these data points, the distribution of prices was still right-skewed with the majority falls under 5 dollars. So we decided to separate the apps into 2 different groups: (those cost less than 5 dollars: cheap apps) and (those are 5 dollars and above: reasonable apps). We called this feature \"Affordability\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to limit the scope of this prototype, we included only 4 more features in our analysis: ratings, affordability, genres and categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "We broke down data into price groups and broke those down according to category and genre to determinr the candidates for application's price increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Price vs. Other Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "We found out that there isn't any meaningful relationship between the price and the rating. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the genres, since each app can belong to several genres, and given that we only have about 700 rows of data, we decided not to dig down into the genres as segmenting by this column could spread our data too thin to extract any significant insights. Instead we limit our analysis to counting the number of genres for each app and computing the average. \n",
    "\n",
    "We noticed that cheap apps with multiple genres cost more than cheap apps with a single genre. Quite the opposite for reasonaable apps. We decided that those apps that cost less than the average are eligible for price increase. \n",
    "\n",
    "The similar strategy applied to categories: We computed the average for each category and cast the vote in analogous way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results and impact\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon casting the votes and finding the majority, out of 733 apps that were analyzed, 401 apps (55%) were deemed eligible for a price increase. \n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the impact of increasing the price of these eligible apps, we want to find the optimal price and have a sense of how many times each app will be purchased. It is not the goal of this prototype to find optimal price, so we used the average price for each app's affordability as a quick proxy.  As for the amount of times each app will be purchased, we don't have access to the data, so we tried to use the number of installations instead. However, this proxy turned out to be unrealistic and inaccurate, so we failed to estimate the impact with the given data. In any case, given that roughly 60% of apps seem to be undervalued, our recommendation is that we move forward with this project. Here are a few options going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Included unused data in analysis.\n",
    "- Get more data: more features (e.g: number of times each app was purchased), more data points.\n",
    "- Select a sample of the eligible apps, increase their price and monitor the behaviour of purchases. \n",
    "- Determine optimal prices for each app.\n"
